# Notes

## Building Goals

This list was written and updated after the basic renderer was built with mouse input.

Viewport goals

- [ ] If Ctrl + Left Click is dragged, lock the viewport about the z axis
- [x] Create an array to hold multiple tetrahedrons at once.
- [x] Build the x1, x2, x3 axis which can always be seen.
- [ ] Create a separate axis in the top right which can be clicked to reset to orthogonal views.
- [ ] Create a keyboard shortcut to reset to a diagonal view (Ctrl + 7).

Vector Math goals

- [ ] Create input fields to enter vectors, and automatically render their cross product and plane if there are only two vectors.
- [ ] Create the cube defined by e1, e2, and e3.
- [ ] Create a matrix input field to apply the linear transformation to the standard cube.

Stretch goals

- [ ] Animate the transformations smoothly (essentially creating keyframs).
